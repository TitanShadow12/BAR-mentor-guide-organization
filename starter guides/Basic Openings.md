# How to Build your Factory and Open Efficiently

Openings in BAR vary based on map, factory choice, current wind speed, and team size. Generally, you want to build as many metal extractors close to your commander as possible, build enough energy structures so you don't run out completely, then build your factory of choice.

## Selecting a Start Position

Most matches allow you to select your starting position within a set area.

Click anywhere in the green rectangle at the start of a match to set your commander to spawn there. Look for clusters of metal spots that will allow you to place metal extractors quickly, and try to start close to the center of a cluster while still in range to build a metal extractor as soon as you spawn. Your build range is indicated by the circle around your commander.

### What makes a good start position?

Most maps have small clusters of 3 metal spots arranged in the start box, marking clear options for players to choose from or for teammates to distribute among themselves.

Some maps may have only pairs of metal spots available, or no clusters at all. Look at the number on the metal spot carefully, and look for starting positions with pairs of higher value metal spots - or even solitary high-value metal spots (e.g. 4.0+). These can be powerful starting positions as well.

## Basic Openings

The below two factories make up the majority of openings:

- Bot factory
- Vehicle factory

Other factories will be covered in depth in other guides:

- Air factory - specific to air, possible start option in team games, usually bootstrapped with a bot factory opening
- Hover factory - specific to land + sea maps, usually bootstrapped with a bot factory opening
- Shipyard - specific to sea maps or sea lanes in team games

### Steps

(Assuming 3 metal extractor spot)

1. 2 metal extractors
2. 2 wind generators (if average wind is higher than 7 and current wind is higher than 4), otherwise 1 solar generator
    - Current wind is indicated at the top-right by the windmill icon, average wind varies based on map and can be seen by mousing over the windmill icon
3. 3rd metal extractor
4. Bot factory, or 1 wind generator / 1 solar generator then Vehicle factory
    - Vehicles do better on flat ground and slow pushing, bots do better on hills and have more numbers
5. Build more wind generators / solar panels as needed with the commander, start producing a constructor. Use the commander to partially assist the factory with the constructor, but don't run out of energy!
6. Use the constructor to assist the factory, build ~2 scouts for base defense. Build another constructor
7. From here you have options - make sure you have enough units to defend the base, or build a Guard/Sentry tower as protection. Get the commander to the frontline, unless you're playing as a backline techer. Build more constructors, send them out to claim metal spots. Build more units and go after your opponent.
