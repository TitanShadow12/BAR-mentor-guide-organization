# What kind of game is Beyond all reason
In this part of the guide, we will go over the most basic of basic concepts in the RTS (real-time strategy ) game that is BAR.

This manual is created to help players grasp the most important step toward becoming an expert in BAR ( or anything else if the reader could understand the underlying concept and apply to other things instead of just in BAR )	

## What is Beyond all reason
Beyond all reason or **BAR** is one of the up-and-coming **RTS** in development. It is in **Alpha** state right now and should
be changed sometime in the future. Feedback, player data, and bug reports will help toward this direction.

The game right now has **PVE**, **PVP**, and **campaign** readily avaible for those that are interested in playing

Going more into details **BAR** have multiples concepts and the most basic being **Strategy**, **Real-time** and yes even **game**

Each of those concepts comes with a multitude of underlying theories and such will be quite an amount of information to distill into one book,
so here I ( the writer ) will try to explain to you ( the reader ) some of those which I found will be useful in getting your Logos in the game. ~~hopefully, pathos and ethos also~~

### Game

1. winning ( goal )
2. playing ( rules and why )
3. fun ( funnnn )

### Strategy

1. control

units and movements, attacking and defending

2. planning

preparedness and forward thinking ability

3. management ( The rebellious teen child of control and planning )

resources balancing and efficiency

3. situational awareness

environments and opposition awareness

4. situation handling

keeping your head running at the same speed under duress through preparation or mentality

### Real-time

1. simulated speed

"Early computer strategy games adhered firmly to the turn-based concepts of their board game ancestors, where�by necessity�players had time to plan their turns before their opponents had a chance to move.
Real-time strategy changed all of that so that games would begin to more closely resemble reality: Time was limited, and if you wasted yours, your opponents would probably be taking advantage of theirs."
-Bruce Geryk (https://web.archive.org/web/20110427052656/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/real_time/)

2. multiple tasks management (multi-tasking)
